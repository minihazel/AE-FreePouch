# hazelify-AEFreeContainers-1.0.0
Developed by hazelify as part of the JET / AE project. Designed to help fellow gamers expand and customize containers in the game.

## Info
FreeContainers is a 12.11 exclusive mod that allows any items to be stored in any containers in-game.

By default, the [Aquamari](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Aquamari_water_bottle_with_filter) and [USEC MRE](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/MRE_ration_pack) are filtered for the [S I C C Organizational Pouch](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/S_I_C_C_Organizational_pouch) to show users how to filter items by themselves.

## To-do
Coming in future updates:
* Clean up the fetching process
* More readable script and filter
* Integrate filter into mod.config.json file
* Ability to filter any in-game container and how many items to allow for each
* **Potential**: Ability to change slot size (height and width) of any in-game container

## Versions
**1.0.0**: Ability to filter items and categories for the [S I C C Organizational Pouch](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/S_I_C_C_Organizational_pouch)
