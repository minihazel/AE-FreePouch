# hazelify-Cases-1.0.3
Developed by hazelify as part of the JET / AE project. Designed to help fellow singleplayer gamers expand and customize containers in the game.

# Info
Cases is an AE exclusive mod that allows any items to be stored in any containers in-game.

This version is 12.12 exclusive. Refer to [my 12.9 version](https://github.com/minihazel/12.9-Cases) for a 12.9 compatible version!

By default, the [Aquamari](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Aquamari_water_bottle_with_filter) and [USEC MRE](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/MRE_ration_pack) are filtered for the [S I C C pouch](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/S_I_C_C_Organizational_pouch) to show users how to filter items by themselves.
